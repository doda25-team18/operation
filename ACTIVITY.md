### Week Q2.1 (Nov 10+)

No work

### Week Q2.2 (Nov 17+)

- Diana:
    - https://github.com/doda25-team18/operation/pull/1

    I have worked on A1 (F7), where I created a `docker-compose` file to run the application.

- Fedor
    - https://github.com/doda25-team18/model-service/pull/4

    My job in A1 was implementing 2 workflows (for the app and model-service repositories) to automate the release of docker container images. All requested parts mentioned under F8 have been implemented (with the version being determined by the 
    <version> in the pom.xml file in both workflows).
- Samuel
    - https://github.com/doda25-team18/lib-version/pull/7
      
    This week I worked on A1, dockerizing frontend and backend (including flexible containers and multi-stage images). I also implemented the automatic version-bumping behavior of the release workflow in lib-version.

- Jan: https://github.com/doda25-team18/model-service/pull/5  
  I have implemented features F1 (app uses lib-version dependency and shows its version) and 
  F10 (model is downloaded and used from volume mount instead of being hardcoded).
