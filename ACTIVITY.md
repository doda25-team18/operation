    I have worked on A1 (F7), where I created a `docker-compose` file to run the application.

- Fedor
    - https://github.com/doda25-team18/model-service/pull/4
    - https://github.com/doda25-team18/app/pull/4/

    My job in A1 was implementing 2 workflows (for the app and model-service repositories) to automate the release of docker container images. All requested parts mentioned under F8 have been implemented (with the version being determined by the 
    <version> in the pom.xml file in both workflows).
