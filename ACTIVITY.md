No work

### Week Q2.2 (Nov 17+)

- Diana:
    - https://github.com/doda25-team18/operation/pull/1

    I have worked on A1 (F7), where I created a `docker-compose` file to run the application and a `README` with instructions.

- Fedor
    - https://github.com/doda25-team18/model-service/pull/4

    My job in A1 was implementing 2 workflows (for the app and model-service repositories) to automate the release of docker container images. All requested parts mentioned under F8 have been implemented (with the version being determined by the 
    <version> in the pom.xml file in both workflows).

    This week I worked on A1, dockerizing frontend and backend (including flexible containers and multi-stage images). I also implemented the automatic version-bumping behavior of the release workflow in lib-version.

- Jan: https://github.com/doda25-team18/model-service/pull/5  
  I have implemented features F1 (app uses lib-version dependency and shows its version) and 
  F10 (model is downloaded and used from volume mount instead of being hardcoded).

- Yasar
    - https://github.com/doda25-team18/lib-version/pull/6
    This week I implemented features F2 and F11 for A1.

- Sanjay
      - https://github.com/doda25-team18/model-service/blob/main/.github/workflows/train.yml
      - Implemented F9 for A1

    This week I completed Steps 1 through 4 of the Kubernetes cluster assignment.

- Diana
    - https://github.com/doda25-team18/operation/pull/15

    This week I worked on A2, where I did the steps from 8 to 12. In this I managed `etc/hosts/`, I added the Kubernetes repository, I installed the K8 tools, I configured `containerd` and I started and enabled `kubelet`.
