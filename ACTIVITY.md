No work

### Week Q2.2 (Nov 17+)

- Diana:
    - https://github.com/doda25-team18/operation/pull/1

    I have worked on A1 (F7), where I created a `docker-compose` file to run the application.

- Fedor
    - https://github.com/doda25-team18/model-service/pull/4
    - https://github.com/doda25-team18/app/pull/4/

    My job in A1 was implementing 2 workflows (for the app and model-service repositories) to automate the release of docker container images.  

- Jan: https://github.com/doda25-team18/model-service/pull/5  
  I have implemented features F1 (app uses lib-version dependency and shows its version) and 
  F10 (model is downloaded and used from volume mount instead of being hardcoded).
